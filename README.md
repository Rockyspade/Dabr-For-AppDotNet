Dabr is the insanely popular mobile-web front end for Twitter.  It's now available for App.Net

Dabr is a highly customisable HTML5 site which works well on mobile and desktop. It is primarily designed for low-end phones which may not have the power to run complex sites or apps.  It also works well on Internet TVs.

Tested on BlackBerry, Symbian, Android, iPhone, Maemo, iOS, Bada, Panasonic Viera TVs, LG TVs, Wii.

You can easily install it on your own server, or use my public version at http://dabr.eu/adn/
If you are on Android, you can use this web-view app on the Google Play Store http://bit.ly/DabrAndroidADN
